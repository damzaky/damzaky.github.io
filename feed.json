I thought it was hard to just make this kind of thing, I google a bit and found out that to only make such thing is not that hard since there is an official API to make such thing. Now that I can make it easily, I want to make something that is harder to make, so I decided to make this bot called dambot that can plot mathematical function by sending the f(x) equation.How it worksSo basically, a user send an equation, starts with command: @dambot f(x)=... and then fill the … with a mathematical function, e.g: x^2. Then the message is sent to the server, the server will draw the image based on the equation and send the image back to the user.To add this bot: @dqj2250mScreenshootsTechnology usedGoogle App EnginePHP",
